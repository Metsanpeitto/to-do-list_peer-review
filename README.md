## Learning objectives

- Give feedback on someone else's project based on clean code best practices.
Apply knowledge the student has gained in the past when giving a code review.
Perform a simple code review for a coding partner.
Understand existing code in a way that allows the student to give a good code review.


### Preparation
Create a new empty repo.
Copy your code from the "To Do list" project and commit it as one big chunk of code in a feature branch.
Open a pull request.
Ask you partner for a review in GitHub.
Share the pull request link with your partner.
Instructions
Once you get a pull request link from your partner, go ahead and review it:
Reminder: How to give a code review.
Check the quality of the code (you can use previous lessons as a guide). Remember to check for the following:
JavaScript best practices.
DRY, KISS, and YAGNI rules.
HTML & CSS best practices.
Finish your review with a nice summary.
Compare your review with the issue created by the project's author in the Do I follow JavaScript best practices? exercise.
There is no need to add anything to your review at this point. It is just to check if you both noticed the same issues.
Check the review you received from your partner! 
You will make improvements to your code based on your partner's review in the next exercise.
